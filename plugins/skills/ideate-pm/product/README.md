# Product data (generated)

This folder is the **repo-scoped product memory** maintained by the
`product-requirements` skill.

- `memory.sqlite` is the authoritative store.
- `views/` contains compiled Markdown views you can read at any time:
  - `views/PRODUCT.md`
  - `views/BACKLOG.md`
  - `views/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`

You generally should not hand-edit the SQLite file. If you want to adjust content,
edit via the skill workflow and re-compile views.
