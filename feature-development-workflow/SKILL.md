  This skill should be used when the user asks to "implement a feature",
  "add a new feature", "develop feature", "refactor module", "upgrade API",
  "migrate database", or invokes "/feature". Also triggers on complex multi-file
  bugfixes, architectural changes, or when user mentions "feature workflow".
  Provides a 5-phase systematic approach: Discovery -> Exploration ->
  Documentation -> Implementation -> Review.

# Feature Development Workflow

> Systematic feature development: Discovery → Exploration → Documentation → Implementation → Review

## Overview

A comprehensive 5-phase workflow for feature development that emphasizes:
- **Documentation-first**: Spec documents before code
- **Progressive context**: Fork context prevents main session pollution
- **Progress persistence**: Resume interrupted work seamlessly
- **Multi-model agents**: Right model for each task (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)

## Hard Rules

- Speak with user in **Simplified Chinese**, write all artifacts in **English**
- Do not skip decision gates without explicit user confirmation
- Keep diffs minimal; avoid unrelated refactors
- Update progress.md after each phase transition
- Run verification before marking tasks complete

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Discovery     ->  Phase 2: Exploration  ->  Phase 3: Documentation
   (clarify & decide)       (understand codebase)     (contracts & specs)
         |                         |                         |
         v                         v                         v
   [GATE: confirm]           [parallel agents]         [GATE: approve]
                                                             |
                                                             v
                              Phase 4: Implementation  <-  Phase 3b: Tasks
                                 (incremental, verified)    (breakdown)
                                         |
                                         v
                              Phase 5: Review & PR
```

## File Structure

All artifacts live under `.works/spec/{feature-name}/` (gitignored):

```
.works/spec/{feature-name}/
├── progress.md        # Progress tracking (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
├── README.md          # Index + core decisions
├── contracts.md       # Data contracts (input/output/API)
├── tasks.md           # Task breakdown with status
└── PR.md              # PR description template
```

Initialize with: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/init.sh {feature-name}`

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Transform vague requirements into actionable decisions

**Agents**: `product-thinker` (Opus) for deep product analysis

**Actions**:
1. Initialize workspace with `init.sh {feature-name}`
2. Create progress.md with initial state
3. Ask clarifying questions using numbered format (Q1, Q2...)
4. Record decisions in README.md

**GATE**: Confirm all decisions with user before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

**Goal**: Understand relevant existing code and patterns

**Agents**: `codebase-explorer` (Haiku, fast) - launch 2-3 in parallel

**Actions**:
1. Launch parallel agents targeting:
   - Similar features and implementation patterns
   - Architecture and abstractions
   - UI patterns and state management
2. Read all key files identified by agents
3. Present comprehensive findings summary
4. Update progress.md
5. if the `ast-grep` tool is exsiting, please use it. here is the Command line usage example :
   ```bash
      ## ast-grep has following form.
      ast-grep --pattern 'var code = $PATTERN' --rewrite 'let code = new $PATTERN' --lang ts
      ## Example : Rewrite code in null coalescing operator
      ast-grep -p '$A && $A()' -l ts -r '$A?.()'
      ## Example : Rewrite Zodios
      ast-grep -p 'new Zodios($URL,  $CONF as const,)' -l ts -r 'new Zodios($URL, $CONF)' -i
   ```

---

## Phase 3: Documentation & Tasks

**Goal**: Create spec documents and task breakdown

**Agents**: `architect` (Sonnet) for implementation blueprint

### Sub-phase 3a: Documentation
1. Write contracts.md with field definitions, types, examples
2. Update README.md with decisions summary

**GATE**: User approves spec documents

### Sub-phase 3b: Task Breakdown
1. Launch `architect` agent for implementation design
2. Split feature into atomic, verifiable tasks in tasks.md
3. Each task: Goal, Size (S/M/L), Files, Acceptance criteria

**GATE**: User confirms task list

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

**Goal**: Build the feature incrementally

**Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/{feature-name}

# 2. For each task:
#    - Update tasks.md status to "in_progress"
#    - Implement changes
#    - Run verification
#    - Update tasks.md status to "completed"
#    - Update progress.md

# 3. Periodic verification
bun run check && bun run test
```

**DO NOT START WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**

---

## Phase 5: Review & PR

**Goal**: Ensure quality and submit

**Agents**: `reviewer` (Sonnet) for code quality review

**Actions**:
1. Launch `reviewer` agent to check simplicity, correctness, conventions
2. Present findings and ask user decision (fix now/later/proceed)
3. Final verification: `bun run check && bun run test && bun run build`
4. Create PR with spec reference
5. Update CHANGELOG.md
6. Mark progress.md as completed

---

## Progress Tracking

progress.md uses YAML frontmatter for structured data:

```yaml
---
feature: feature-name
phase: 2
phase_name: exploration
status: in_progress
branch: feat/feature-name
started_at: 2025-01-13T10:00:00Z
updated_at: 2025-01-13T11:30:00Z
decisions:
  - id: Q1
    question: API output format
    answer: JSON with pagination
completed_phases:
  - phase: 1
    completed_at: 2025-01-13T10:30:00Z
---
```

## Resuming Workflow

When resuming an interrupted session:
1. Check for existing progress.md in .works/spec/
2. Read current phase and context
3. Continue from last recorded state
4. Ask user to confirm before proceeding
