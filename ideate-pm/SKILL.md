# Product Requirements Manager (Repo-scoped)

This skill manages product design information for **one product per repo**. It
maintains a requirements collection (a set of requirement items) and the
associated design decisions and open questions.

This skill does not manage engineering tasks or implement code. It only
captures and evolves product requirements.

## Core storage (authoritative)

- SQLite DB: `product/memory.sqlite`
- Views (compiled): `product/views/PRODUCT.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`

This skill intentionally stores its data **inside the skill folder** so users do not
need to learn an extra top-level directory convention.

## Operations

### 1) Initialize repo product

Run once per repo:

```bash
python scripts/init_product.py --title "<product name>"
```

### 2) Add a requirement

When the user proposes a new feature/capability:

```bash
python scripts/add_requirement.py --description "<requirement idea>"
```

### 3) Refine a requirement

When the user wants to make a requirement more concrete:

```bash
python scripts/refine_requirement.py --id R-001
```

### 4) Show current product design

When the user asks “当前产品怎么设计的？” or similar:

```bash
python scripts/query_state.py
```

Optional persistence helpers (use when relevant):

```bash
python scripts/record_decision.py --scope product --question "..." --choice "..."
python scripts/add_open_question.py --scope requirement --ref R-001 --question "..."
```
